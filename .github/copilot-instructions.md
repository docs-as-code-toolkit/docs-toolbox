# Repository Instructions For GitHub Copilot

Follow the project `AGENTS.md`.

This project uses architecture-knowledge-toolkit for architecture documentation,
ADRs, quality scenarios, risks, traceability metadata, templates, validators,
generated include fragments, and SDLC task workflows that are not described more
specifically in this repository.

Use the toolkit repository as source of truth when local toolkit files are missing:

https://github.com/docs-as-code-toolkit/architecture-knowledge-toolkit

For architecture-related or SDLC workflow changes:

- prefer small, reviewable changes
- preserve stable IDs
- keep AI-generated or AI-modified architecture content in `draft` or `proposed` state unless reviewed
- do not manually maintain generated fragments
- consult the relevant toolkit skill before issue slicing, issue implementation, commit message, pull request review, post-merge synchronization, ADR, quality scenario, risk, or traceability-review work when local instructions are missing
- do not introduce Copilot-specific rules into engine-independent toolkit files
